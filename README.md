Oasis Infobyte Internship - Web Development - Level-2

This repository contains the completed tasks for the Oasis Infobyte internship. In this internship, I had the opportunity to work on various tasks at different levels, and I selected Level-2 for my project.

Task Details

Task 1: Calculator App
In this task, I developed a calculator web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The interface is user-friendly and responsive.

Task 2: Tribute Page - Mother Teresa
For the second task, I created a tribute page dedicated to Mother Teresa. The page provides information about her life, achievements, and contributions. It includes a visually appealing design and relevant content to honor her significant impact.

Task 3: Todo Web App
The third task involved building a todo web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The todo app allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them when necessary. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing and organizing tasks effectively.

Task 4: Creating a Login Authentication System 
The final challenge was to create a login authentication system. I chose JavaScript and flask to implement registration, login, and secure access to a page and modify the data like remove or update candidate info. This project expanded my skills in python, javascript and gave me how to work on real-world application.
