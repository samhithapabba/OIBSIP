                <h2>A Life of Selfless Service</h2>
                <p>
                    Mother Teresa was a Catholic nun who dedicated her life to caring for the poor, the sick, the orphaned, and the dying. Born Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu in Skopje (now North Macedonia) in 1910, she moved to India in 1929 and, for almost two decades, taught history and geography at a school in Calcutta.

                <h3>The Call to Serve</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1946, while on a train journey, she experienced what she called "the call within the call," which led her to leave the convent and devote herself to working in the slums of Calcutta. This was the true genesis of her mission. She began teaching poor children and tending to the needs of the destitute.

                <h3>The Missionaries of Charity</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1950, Mother Teresa founded the **Missionaries of Charity**, an organization devoted to service. Her mission was to care for "the hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society." The organization established hospices, homes for the dying, soup kitchens, clinics, and schools. By the time of her death, the Missionaries of Charity operated in over 133 countries.

                <h3>Admiration and Legacy</h3>
                <p>
                    What I adore most about Mother Teresa is her unwavering **humility** and **tenacity**. She saw dignity in every human being, no matter how marginalized, and acted on her faith with profound courage. She proved that the smallest acts of kindness can collectively change the world. She received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 and was canonized as a saint in 2016. Her legacy is a timeless reminder that we are called to serve those in greatest need.
